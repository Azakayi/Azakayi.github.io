## Short letter 
*Dear Ykay, as this year comes to an end, I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for having you by my side. I started the year with us being friends and now it's ending with us as lovers. How time flies, right? Your presence has meant the world to me, and I seriously cannot thank you enough for being there through thick and thin; from practices to ANSGO events, even just late night calls. This year has been an absolute rollercoaster of emotions but your support kept me going throughout the year, sure there may have been some setbacks, problems, lack of communication but nevertheless, you stayed and that's all that matters. Looking back, I remember the laughter we've shared, the memories we've created and of course the joy we've experienced together. These moments have been the highlight of my chaotic year and I will always cherish them deeply. You know how much I love music so I'll give out a quick analogy; your laughter is like music to my ears and I just can't get enough - I think about it constantly throughout my days. Seeing you, talking with you, doing things with you will always be the best part of any school day, or of any day in fact. We faced some challenges but your unwavering presence made them easier to overcome. Your resilience and your stubborness (in a good way) in hard times has inspired me. I think that with you, I can handle any problem life throws at us. As we start a new year, I want you to know that my love for you has only grown stronger. I look forward to more moments, laughter, and love in the coming year. Thank you for being my partner, for giving me a second chance, and for being the pink in my cheeks. With love, akey*
